and travel sites, from major booking sites to individual company sites, to give you as many cheap airfare options as possible. When you conduct a single search on momondo, you can find and compare cheap airline tickets like you’ve done hundreds of searches at once. momondo is completely free to use - with no hidden charges or fees - and the prices you see are never affected by your searches, no matter how many you make. We believe in an open world, where travelling and getting acquainted across borders and cultures is available to us all, so we’re committed to showing you the cheapest flights in our flight finder. How can Mix & Match save me money? Sometimes you can save money by combining flight tickets from different suppliers, and we call that Mix & Match. This means you can book your outbound flight with one supplier, and your return flight with another. If you can save money by combining tickets from different suppliers, we’ll automatically include this option in your flight results and label it Mix & Match. You’ll have to complete two separate booking flows after you select this deal on our site, but it’s worth it if you can save money over a traditional round-trip with one supplier. It’s an advanced way of getting the cheapest flights even if they’re offered by different suppliers. How do I find the best price on plane tickets? Choose your destination and preferred travel dates, and we’ll provide you with an overview of the cheapest, quickest, and best flights so you can compare prices and book flights with confidence. Flexible on dates? It’s even easier to find cheap flights by using our Price Calendar (found above your search results), which shows you the cheapest travel dates. This is available on all of our most popular flight routes. How do I make sure I don’t miss a flight deal? Sign up for Price Alerts on your favourite flight routes and automatically get live price updates, so you can book flights when the price is right. You can do so next to your flight search results or in the profile menu. If you're on our app, you will find Price Alerts in the navigation menu. You can also subscribe to special offers and limited-time flight deals from our partners. Just sign in, go to Notifications in your profile and subscribe to the topics you’re interested in.
